# Django Starter Template

This is a django starter template that I use for django projects mainly to save time on initial project setup.
It just has the standard gitignore, some abstract models and a script to rename the project to what I want.
 
To rename project run
```python
python manage.py renameproject <new_project_name>
```

This is a work in progress and I will hopefully add more to it.

This can still be used to start projects though ;-)
